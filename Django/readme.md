# Django Project Template
.
This repository, maintained by [17arhaan](https://github.com/17arhaan), provides a template for a Django project. Use this as a starting point for your web application development with Django.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- **Django**: This project requires Django. You can install it via pip.
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `virtualenv`.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt`, you can install Django manually:

```bash
pip install django
```

### 4. Apply Migrations

Before running the project, apply any database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser (Optional)

To access Django’s admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view your application.

## Project Structure

A typical Django project structure looks like this:

```plaintext
myproject/
├── manage.py
├── myproject/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── app1/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── views.py
```

- **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.
- **myproject/**: The project configuration directory containing settings, URL configurations, and WSGI configuration.
- **app1/**: An example Django app where you can define models, views, templates, and tests.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for your Django apps, execute:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Deployment

For deploying your Django project to a production environment, refer to the [Django deployment checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/checklist/).

### Additional Deployment Tips

- Use a production-ready web server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI.
- Serve static files using a dedicated web server like Nginx.
- Secure your application by setting `DEBUG = False` and configuring allowed hosts.
